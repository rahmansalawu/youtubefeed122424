Hey, the Mega millions jackpot jumps again overnight after another drawing without a big winner. Look at this updated billboard this morning. At least $825 million will be up for grabs when a new set of numbers are drawn Friday night. As for last night's numbers, here they are 56, 66, 67, 68, 69 and the Gold Mega Ball was 18. The jackpot has been rolling over since early September, but four numbers in succession. That's crazy. I wonder how many times that's ever happened. What are the odds of that? That's. That's what nobody wants. I know, and Bill was only one number off. That was it, right, Bill? That's what you told us. I",

I can't recall the Mega Ball number or if it was even a Powerball or Mega Millions ticket. I found the combination odd, so I ended up purchasing another quick-pick ticket. When I got home, I looked up past drawings to see if there had been any similar sequences. I even asked ChatGPT about the likelihood of such a pattern, and it confirmed that it was highly improbable. sometimes if i have extra few dollars sometimes I would do something like 9s like 9 , 19, 29, 39, 49 but yeah all this drawing is little odd 👀",
